Pre-requiste namespaces list:
_____________________________
1. System.Net: This namespace provides classes for accessing and interacting with network resources. It includes classes like WebClient for downloading data from URLs, HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse for making HTTP requests and handling responses, TcpClient and TcpListener for working with TCP connections, and more. In the context of sending emails, this namespace is essential for establishing connections to SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) servers.
2. System.Net.Mail: This namespace is specifically designed for handling email functionality within .NET applications. It provides classes like MailMessage for creating email messages, SmtpClient for sending email via SMTP servers, and Attachment for including file attachments in emails. Using this namespace, you can easily set up and send emails from your C# applications using SMTP, which is precisely what you would need for your project to set up Gmail's SMTP connection and send emails.

In summary, you need these namespaces (System.Net and System.Net.Mail) in your C# project to handle network operations and send emails, respectively. They provide the necessary functionality and classes to establish connections to SMTP servers and send email messages efficiently.
